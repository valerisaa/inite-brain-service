/**
 * Closed-vocabulary, span-grounded entity-and-fact extractor.
 *
 * The design follows the 2025-era SOTA for LLM-based information extraction:
 *   1. Span grounding — the model returns a verbatim substring of the input as
 *      the object value. The server validates the span actually occurs in the
 *      source and drops any fact that doesn't ground. The model literally
 *      cannot invent values (no more "object=active" when the text says
 *      "CTO"). References: LangExtract (Google), Anthropic Citations API,
 *      Deterministic Quoting (Yeung 2024), AFEV (Fact in Fragments,
 *      arXiv:2506.07446).
 *
 *   2. Decompose-then-extract — the model first lists `clauses[]` — verbatim
 *      sub-spans of the input, each one an independent assertion — and then
 *      assigns one or more facts per clause. Eliminates the "multi-clause
 *      collapse" failure mode where a 3-fact sentence yields 1 fact.
 *      References: FactScore, AFEV, RexUIE.
 *
 *   3. Predicate definitions are TYPE SIGNATURES, not example values. Each
 *      predicate is described by (subject domain, object range, admission
 *      criteria, negative disambiguation against near-neighbour predicates,
 *      value-span shape). No sample values from any specific vertical appear
 *      in the prompt — this is what stops the model from copying example
 *      words verbatim into outputs ("status=active" failure). References:
 *      RexUIE, ODKE+ (arXiv:2509.04696), PARSE (arXiv:2510.08623).
 *
 * One LLM call per ingest, json_schema strict, no retry loop in the hot path
 * — server-side validation drops malformed facts and traces them for offline
 * schema iteration (PARSE recommendation).

OUTPUT CONTRACT
You output JSON with four top-level fields, in this order:

  1. clauses[] — verbatim sub-spans of the input. Each entry is ONE independent
     assertion. A sentence with two conjuncts ("X is the CTO and prefers vegan
     lunch") produces TWO clauses, not one. A two-sentence input produces at
     least two clauses. Copy each clause verbatim from the input — never
     summarise or rephrase.

  2. entities[] — actors named in the input. Each entry has name (verbatim
     mention), type (closed enum: ${ENTITY_TYPE_VOCABULARY.join(', ')}), and
     canonical (the canonical/legal form ONLY when the text states it
     explicitly, otherwise null).

  3. facts[] — assertions about the entities. Each fact has:
       entityIndex   — 0-based index into entities[]
       clauseIndex   — 0-based index into clauses[] (the clause warranting this fact)
       predicate     — chosen from the closed predicate vocabulary
       valueSpan     — VERBATIM SUBSTRING of the input naming the value
       confidence    — 0..1, reserve >0.8 for explicit assertions, 0.5–0.8 for inferred

  4. edges[] — entity-to-entity relationships the input asserts. A fact captures
     an attribute of ONE entity (Maria.address=Berlin); an edge captures a
     LINK between TWO named entities (Maria works_at Acme). Each edge has:
       fromEntityIndex — 0-based index into entities[] (source)
       toEntityIndex   — 0-based index into entities[] (target)
       kind            — lowercase snake_case relationship type (works_at,
                         lives_at, affiliated_with, owns, knows, ...)
       clauseIndex     — 0-based index into clauses[]
       confidence      — 0..1

     Emit an edge whenever the text places one named entity in relation to
     another. "X is the CTO at Y" → edge (X, works_at, Y). "X joined Y" →
     edge (X, works_at, Y). "X owns Y" → edge (X, owns, Y). "X lives in Y"
     where Y is a named location → edge (X, lives_at, Y) IN ADDITION to the
     address fact (the fact carries the value, the edge carries the link).

     Closed vocabulary is preferred when applicable; coin a new kind only
     when none fits. Edges that the text does not warrant are dropped server-
     side via the bounds check on entityIndex.

THE VERBATIM RULE (most important):
  valueSpan MUST appear character-for-character somewhere in the input.
  • Copy from the source. Do not paraphrase.
  • Do not substitute a synonym, a normalised form, or a canonical label.
  • Do not use any word from THESE INSTRUCTIONS that doesn't appear in the input.
  • The server validates substring containment and drops any fact whose
    valueSpan is not found. A dropped fact is worse than a missing fact.
  • If you cannot find a substring of the input that names the value, do not
    emit the fact.

PREDICATE SELECTION (closed-preferred, open-coined)
For each clause, pick the SINGLE most specific predicate from the vocabulary
below. Each predicate card encodes its TYPE / ADMIT / NOT FOR / VALUE rules
— read them carefully before choosing.

If — and ONLY if — no listed predicate admits the clause, you may coin a
new predicate. Constraints on a coined predicate:
  • lowercase snake_case, single noun-phrase ("hobby", "citizenship",
    "preferred_pronoun", "medication_taken"). NOT verb phrases.
  • Must describe the SHAPE of the assertion, not a specific value.
  • Use this only when the existing vocab is genuinely the wrong slot for
    the clause — not as a paraphrase preference. The server runs an EDC
    similarity check downstream and will auto-alias your coined predicate
    to an existing one when they overlap; if the coin survives, it's
    proposed for review.
A coined predicate must NOT be a verb ("eats", "lives") — pick the
existing predicate whose TYPE describes that assertion (preference,
address, etc.) instead.

GENERAL RULES
  • Each clause produces zero or more facts. A clause that asserts no
    extractable predicate (e.g. a greeting) produces zero.
  • Multiple distinct assertions about the same subject — even in a single
    sentence — each get their own fact.
  • Skip entities that appear only as pronouns with no resolvable antecedent.
  • temperature is near-zero; pick the predicate the type-signatures admit,
    not the predicate that's "close enough".
  • The output JSON schema is strict — fields that don't conform are rejected
    by the runtime. valueSpan grounding is enforced server-side.
