Decide intent:
  - "tell" — the user is stating a fact or asserting new information (declarative).
  - "ask" — the user is querying existing knowledge (interrogative or imperative search).

Entity canonicalisation (CRITICAL — this is what keeps the graph from accumulating
duplicate people / orgs across mentions):
  The graph already knows the entities listed under "known canonical names".
  If the user uses a short reference (first name, alias, possessive pronoun chain
  that resolves to one of them) that UNAMBIGUOUSLY matches exactly one known
  name, rewrite the message to use the full canonical form.

  HARD RULE — normalizedMessage MUST preserve every clause / fact in the original
  message. Substitute names only. DO NOT drop clauses. DO NOT summarise. DO NOT
  collapse a multi-fact sentence into one fact. Word count should stay within
  ±25% of the original. If you find yourself shortening, you are doing it wrong.

  Allowed transformations on normalizedMessage:
    1. Replace a short entity reference with its canonical form
       ("Maria" → "Maria Petrov", "she" → "Maria Petrov" when antecedent is clear).
    2. Replace state-change verbs with a present-tense predicate noun that
       names the RESULTING STATE — but ONLY the verb phrase; every other
       clause stays verbatim. The rewrite is TENSE-AGNOSTIC: past, present
       and future-tense state changes all collapse to present-state form,
       because validFrom (returned separately) is what dates the state.
         "switched to keto"            → "now prefers keto"
         "moved to Berlin"             → "now lives in Berlin"
         "moves to Dublin" (future)    → "lives in Dublin"
         "will move to Paris"          → "lives in Paris"
         "becomes the new CTO"         → "is the CTO"
         "started using Stripe"        → "uses Stripe"
       This helps the downstream extractor classify the fact as a stable
       state predicate (address / preference / status / interacted_with)
       rather than a transient "intent". When the verb names a change
       toward a stable resulting state, the resulting state is the fact.
    3. Strip ANY temporal anchor ("since February", "last month", "next
       month", "yesterday", "tomorrow", "в марте", "через неделю") from
       normalizedMessage when you have returned it as validFrom. The
       timestamp is captured separately and repeating it bloats the
       extractor input and confuses tense classification.

  IMPORTANT INTERACTION between #2 and #3: when a tell carries BOTH a
  state-change verb AND a temporal anchor (e.g. "next month Maria moves to
  Dublin"), apply #3 first to remove the anchor and #2 to collapse the
  state-change verb. The output normalizedMessage should look like a clean
  present-tense assertion of the resulting state ("Maria Petrov lives in
  Dublin"), with validFrom holding the temporal anchor. This is what makes
  bitemporal extraction work end-to-end through chat — the extractor sees
  the state predicate, validFrom records when the state begins, and a
  later asOf query correctly returns the right slice.

  Example (multi-fact):
    known = ["Maria Petrov"], message =
      "since February Maria is our new CTO at Acme. She moved from Berlin and prefers vegan lunch."
    →
      normalizedMessage = "Maria Petrov is our new CTO at Acme. Maria Petrov lives in Berlin and prefers vegan lunch."
      validFrom         = <Feb 1 ISO>
    Note: three facts in the original — CTO@Acme, lives-in Berlin, prefers vegan
    lunch. THREE facts in the normalized form. None dropped.

  Example (short ref + change of state, single fact):
    known = ["Maria Petrov"], message = "Maria switched to keto last month"
    →
      normalizedMessage = "Maria Petrov now prefers keto"
      validFrom         = <1 month ago ISO>

  If a short reference matches MORE than one known name, leave the original
  message in place and let the operator clarify.

Entity references (CRITICAL for retrieval):
  Return entityRefs — the subset of "known canonical names" that the
  message is ABOUT. For "what does Maria eat" with known=["Maria Petrov"],
  return ["Maria Petrov"]. For "what does Maria eat in Berlin" return
  ["Maria Petrov", "Berlin"] only if Berlin is in known. This drives
  graph-first lookup — without it the backend has to fall back to vector
  search every time. If no known name is referenced, return [].

Predicate hints (only for intent="ask" — slot the question into the graph):
  The knowledge graph stores facts under a closed predicate vocabulary.
  When intent="ask", return predicateHints — the subset of predicates the
  question is asking about. The retriever uses this as a hard AND-filter
  so the graph doesn't dump every fact about the subject into the LLM
  context window.

  Mapping intent → predicate (best effort; pick predicates that admit the
  question, multilingual phrasing is fine):
    "where does X live / where is X based / куда переехал / адрес"
        → ["address"]
    "what does X eat / prefer / like / favourite / любимое"
        → ["preference"]
    "what does X want / plan / need / planning to"
        → ["intent"]
    "what is X's role / position / status / title / должность"
        → ["status"]
    "what is X's tier / plan / segment"
        → ["tier"]
    "what's X's email / phone / contact / contact info"
        → ["email", "phone"]
    "what's X's brand voice / tone / archetype / target audience /
        editorial guidelines"
        → one or more of the content-domain predicates that admit it
    "where lives AND what eats" (compound)
        → ["address", "preference"] — union, both slots get fetched
    "tell me about X" / "what do we know about X" / general / unknown
        → [] — empty hints, retriever falls back to top-N recency

  Rules:
   - Only emit predicates from the closed vocabulary above. Anything else
     is dropped server-side.
   - For intent="tell", predicateHints MUST be []. The extractor picks
     predicates during ingest, not the router.
   - When you can't pin a specific predicate confidently, return []. The
     retriever's recency fallback returns a sensible top-N for the subject
     — that's better than guessing wrong and silently dropping the
     relevant fact.

Temporal handling:
  When intent="ask" AND the question contains an EXPLICIT temporal anchor
  ("yesterday", "last month", "in March", "next week", "вчера",
  "на прошлой неделе"), extract it and return it as an ISO 8601 asOf
  timestamp computed relative to "now". Strip the temporal phrase from
  cleanedQuery so retrieval runs on the topical content alone.

  CRITICAL — when intent="ask" and the question contains NO temporal
  anchor (just "where does X live?", "what does X prefer?", "tell me
  about X"), asOf MUST be null. Do NOT default to today, do NOT default
  to "now", do NOT pick midnight of today — null means "current truth"
  to the retriever and is what makes the most-recently-ingested fact
  show up. Picking today-midnight is the WRONG behavior: facts
  ingested later on the same day will appear "not yet valid" and
  retrieval returns empty.

  When intent="tell" AND the message carries a temporal anchor indicating WHEN
  the asserted fact became true ("switched to keto LAST MONTH", "joined in
  MARCH", "moved YESTERDAY", "next month moves to Dublin"), return that
  as validFrom (ISO 8601). This makes bitemporal facts work from chat —
  without it every chat-ingested fact would land with validFrom=now and
  an as-of-past or as-of-future search would miss it.
  When the tell has no temporal anchor, leave validFrom null and the
  ingest will default to now.

Rules:
  - Always pick one of the two intents.
  - asOf and validFrom must each be a valid ISO 8601 timestamp or null.
  - normalizedMessage falls back to the original message when no canonicalisation
    applies.
  - cleanedQuery is only set for ask intent.
  - For "tell" intents asOf must always be null. For "ask" intents validFrom
    must always be null.
