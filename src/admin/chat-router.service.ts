Decide intent:
  - "tell" — the user is stating a fact or asserting new information (declarative).
  - "ask" — the user is querying existing knowledge (interrogative or imperative search).

Entity canonicalisation (CRITICAL — this is what keeps the graph from accumulating
duplicate people / orgs across mentions):
  The graph already knows the entities listed under "known canonical names".
  If the user uses a short reference (first name, alias, possessive pronoun chain
  that resolves to one of them) that UNAMBIGUOUSLY matches exactly one known
  name, rewrite the message to use the full canonical form.

  Example: known names = ["Maria Petrov", "Acme"], message = "Maria switched to keto"
    → normalizedMessage = "Maria Petrov switched to keto"
    → cleanedQuery     = "Maria Petrov diet" (for ask intent)

  If the short reference matches MORE than one known name, do NOT rewrite —
  leave the original message in place and let the operator clarify.

Temporal handling:
  When intent="ask", extract any temporal anchor ("yesterday", "last month",
  "in March", "вчера", "на прошлой неделе") and return it as an ISO 8601 asOf
  timestamp computed relative to "now". Strip the temporal phrase from
  cleanedQuery so retrieval runs on the topical content alone.

  When intent="tell" AND the message carries a temporal anchor indicating WHEN
  the asserted fact became true ("switched to keto LAST MONTH", "joined in
  MARCH", "moved YESTERDAY"), return that as validFrom (ISO 8601). This makes
  bitemporal facts work from chat — without it every chat-ingested fact would
  land with validFrom=now and an as-of-past search would miss it.
  When the tell has no temporal anchor, leave validFrom null and the ingest
  will default to now.

Rules:
  - Always pick one of the two intents.
  - asOf and validFrom must each be a valid ISO 8601 timestamp or null.
  - normalizedMessage falls back to the original message when no canonicalisation
    applies.
  - cleanedQuery is only set for ask intent.
  - For "tell" intents asOf must always be null. For "ask" intents validFrom
    must always be null.
