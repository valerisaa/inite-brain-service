name: brain-recall
description: Recall everything brain knows about one specific entity — current profile, full bitemporal timeline, graph neighbours, and unresolved disagreements. Use when the user names a person/company/thing and asks "tell me about them", "what's their history", or "what do we still disagree about?". For a single-shot LLM briefing without three round-trips, reach for summarize_entity instead.

# brain-recall

When the user points at one entity and asks for the full picture, combine MCP tools in order:

- `summarize_entity` (one-liner briefing — drop into LLM context)
- `get_entity_profile` (now-snapshot — name, refs, active facts)
- `get_entity_timeline` (history — every fact, including retracted)
- `find_related_entities` (graph context — typed edges)
- `get_competing_facts` (unresolved disagreements — pairs the resolver left for adjudication)

Each addresses a different question and the user usually wants pieces of several. The new short-circuit is `summarize_entity` — when the user just wants a single line of context about an entity (not all the facts), it's one call instead of three.

## When to use

- "Tell me about Alice Smith."
- "What's the full history on Acme Corp?"
- "Who is Bob connected to?"
- "What changed for tenant 42 over the last quarter?"

Do **not** use for:
- Open-ended search where the entity isn't yet identified → use `brain-search` first
- Recording new facts → `record_fact`

## How to invoke

Identifying the entity:

- If the user gave a brain entity id (`knowledge_entity:01HXYZ...`), pass it directly.
- If the user named a person/company, call `search_knowledge({ query: "<name>", limit: 3 })` first, pick the top hit's `entity.id`, and confirm with the user if there's ambiguity ("I found two Acmes — Inc and LLC. Which?").
- If the user gave a vertical+id (`rent.cust_42`), call `get_entity_profile({ entityId: "rent.cust_42" })` — brain resolves the external ref.

### Step 0 — briefing (the cheap path)

If the user just wants context, not the full graph:

```ts
summarize_entity({
  entityId: "knowledge_entity:01HXYZ...",
  styleHint: "neutral", // 'neutral' | 'sales' | 'support'
})
```

Returns a one-line briefing — name, type, top 6 most-confident facts, externalRefs. Cached in-process per (entityId, asOf, styleHint), so a hot entity touched across many turns doesn't reload the profile. Use this BEFORE reaching for `get_entity_profile` if all you need is "tell me about them in one breath".

When you do need more than a line, drop down to Step 1.

### Step 1 — profile (now snapshot)

```ts
get_entity_profile({
  entityId: "knowledge_entity:01HXYZ...",
  asOf: undefined,  // omit for "now"
})
```

Returns canonical name, type, all externalRefs (cross-vertical ids), and **active** facts only. This is what brain currently believes is true.

### Step 2 — timeline (full bitemporal sweep)

```ts
get_entity_timeline({
  entityId: "knowledge_entity:01HXYZ...",
  since: "2026-01-01T00:00:00Z",  // optional lower bound
  until: undefined,                // open-ended
})
```

Returns every fact ever recorded, **including retracted and superseded ones**. Each carries `validFrom`, `validUntil`, `recordedAt`, `retractedAt`, and a `status` field (`active` / `superseded` / `retracted`).

Use this when the user asks:
- "What did we know on X?" — filter the returned rows by `recordedAt <= X AND (retractedAt IS NULL OR retractedAt > X)`
- "Did anything get walked back?" — filter to `status = 'retracted'`
- "When did the tier change?" — group `tier` rows by `validFrom`

### Step 3 — connections (graph context)

```ts
find_related_entities({
  entityId: "knowledge_entity:01HXYZ...",
  kind: undefined,  // optional edge filter, e.g. "paid_for", "mentioned_in", "identity_of"
})
```

Returns typed edges and the entities on the other side. Useful for "who else is involved" / "what did they touch" / "merged-with" questions. Edge `kind` filter is open-vocabulary — common kinds include `identity_of` (cross-vertical merge), `paid_for`, `mentioned_in`, `manages`, `member_of`.

### Step 4 — competing facts (unresolved disagreements)

```ts
get_competing_facts({
  entityId: "knowledge_entity:01HXYZ...",
  predicate: undefined,         // optional — filter to one predicate
  asOf: undefined,              // optional — what was competing then
})
```

Returns facts in COMPETING status — pairs (or 3+ groups) the conflict resolver couldn't auto-supersede because they overlap in valid-time and are too cosine-close within margin. Use when the timeline shows two conflicting beliefs and you want to surface the disagreement to the user for adjudication. See `brain-conflict` for resolution workflow.

## Composing a recall

Decide how much to fetch based on the user's question:

| Question shape | Summarize | Profile | Timeline | Connections | Competing |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| "Tell me about X" (one line) | ✓ | — | — | — | — |
| "Tell me about X" (short) | — | ✓ | — | — | — |
| "Full picture on X" | — | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| "What changed about X?" | — | — | ✓ | — | — |
| "Who's X connected to?" | — | ✓ | — | ✓ | — |
| "What did we know on April 1?" | ✓ (with `asOf`) | ✓ (with `asOf`) | — | — | — |
| "What's still being disagreed about?" | — | — | — | — | ✓ |

Don't always pull all five. Each call is a round-trip; spending one when the user asked for the other is rude.

## Reading retracted rows

A retracted fact is **not deleted**. It stays in the timeline with `status: 'retracted'`, `retractedAt: <ts>`, and a reason. Two valid surfaces:

- **Default UX** — hide retracted from the user unless they ask "anything walked back?"
- **Audit UX** — show them inline with a strikethrough or `(retracted: <reason>)` annotation

Never lie that the fact never existed. Brain holds the audit trail precisely so you can show "we used to believe X, then learned otherwise on Y".

## Pitfalls

- **`get_entity_profile` with stale `asOf`** — if you pass `asOf` from a previous turn, you'll get the snapshot from then, not now. Either drop the arg or freshen it to current time.
- **Timeline can be large**. For long-lived entities (years of history) use `since` to window it. The MCP transport will happily ship 10MB JSON; the agent context window won't.
- **Graph walks aren't transitive in one call**. `find_related_entities` returns 1-hop neighbours. For 2+ hops, walk recursively — but stop at 3 hops or the answer drowns in noise.

## Companion tools

- `search_knowledge` — when entity isn't yet identified
- `search_multi_hop` — when the user's question chains evidence across entities
- `memory_diff` — when the question is "what changed in the last week / since last conversation?" (see `brain-bitemporal`)
- `record_fact` / `link_entities` / `retract_fact` — write surface (see `brain-write`)
- `get_competing_facts` + `detect_contradiction` — adjudication workflow (see `brain-conflict`)
