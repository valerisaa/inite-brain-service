/**
 * Smoke coverage for the MCP tool-registration surface.
 *
 * Three things we pin:
 *
 * 1. Read-scope baseline — every read tool registers regardless of
 *    write/admin presence: search_knowledge, search_multi_hop,
 *    synthesize, get_entity_profile, get_entity_timeline,
 *    find_related_entities.
 *
 * 2. brain:write gate — record_fact, retract_fact, link_entities
 *    only register when the caller has brain:write. Without it, a
 *    caller can't drive any mutation from an agent loop.
 *
 * 3. brain:admin gate — forget_entity ONLY registers under
 *    brain:admin. GDPR cascade is irreversible; we don't want it on
 *    a key that only carries brain:write.
 *
 * Inspecting registrations: the SDK keeps tools in a private field
 * `_registeredTools` (a record keyed by tool name). We cast to read
 * it for the test only — production code never touches it.
