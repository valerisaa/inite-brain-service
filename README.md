# INITE Brain Service

Cross-vertical knowledge layer for the INITE ecosystem. **System of insight, not system of record.**

Implements [`inite.service.brain`](https://github.com/inite/inite-ecosystem/blob/main/core/services/brain.yaml) and the [`knowledge`](https://github.com/inite/inite-ecosystem/blob/main/core/capabilities/knowledge.yaml) capability bundle from `inite-ecosystem` v0.2.0-rc.4.

## What it is

Brain maintains a per-tenant **bitemporal knowledge graph** (entities, facts, edges) derived from ecosystem events. Verticals use the `@inite/knowledge` SDK for semantic search and entity profiles, and AI agents connect via a per-tenant MCP endpoint.

Brain does **not** read from any vertical's database. State is ingested through the ecosystem event stream and through public vertical APIs at backfill time. Brain does **not** write back into any vertical's database.

## Architecture position

```
Layer 4 — Verticals
Layer 3 — @inite/* SDKs        ← @inite/knowledge consumes brain
Layer 2 — Horizontal services  ← inite.service.brain (this service)
Layer 1 — Identity (auth)
```

## Status — 0.1.0 walking skeleton

| Endpoint | Status |

| `GET /health` | ✅ |
| `POST /v1/ingest/fact` | ✅ |
| `POST /v1/search` | ✅ |
| `POST /v1/ingest/mention` | planned 0.2.0 |
| `POST /v1/ingest/link` | planned 0.2.0 |

| `POST /v1/facts/:id/retract` | planned 0.2.0 |
| `POST /v1/entities/:id/forget` | planned 0.2.0 |
| `POST /mcp/:companyId` (Streamable HTTP) | planned 0.3.0 |

## Tech stack

- **NestJS 11** + TypeScript
- **SurrealDB 2** with HNSW vector index (`text-embedding-3-small`, 1536 dims)
  - Tenancy: namespace `brain`, database `co_<companyId>` per tenant
- **OpenAI** for embeddings (chat extraction lands in 0.2.0)

## Local development

```bash
# Start SurrealDB
docker compose up -d surrealdb

# Install + run
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env
# Fill OPENAI_API_KEY and (if exposing) BRAIN_API_KEYS

pnpm start:dev
```

### Seed an ApiKey for local testing

```bash
node -e "console.log('sha256:'+require('crypto').createHash('sha256').update('local-dev-key').digest('hex'))"
# → sha256:abc...
```

Put into `.env`:

```
BRAIN_API_KEYS=[{"keyHash":"sha256:abc...","companyId":"co_demo","scopes":["brain:read","brain:write"]}]
```

### Smoke test

```bash
# Ingest one fact
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/v1/ingest/fact \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer local-dev-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "entityRef": { "vertical": "rent", "id": "cust_42" },
    "predicate": "complained_about",
    "object": "late maintenance response",
    "validFrom": "2026-05-05T10:00:00Z",
    "source": { "vertical": "rent", "messageId": "msg_1" }
  }'

# Search
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/v1/search \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer local-dev-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "query": "maintenance issues", "limit": 5 }'
```

## Bitemporal model

Every fact carries two time axes:

- `validFrom` / `validUntil` — when the fact was true in the **real world**
- `recordedAt` / `retractedAt` — when **brain knew** about it

This enables both "what was true on date X" and "what did we know on date X" queries. Retractions never delete; they close `validUntil` and set `retractedAt`. The fact row stays for audit.

## Predicate vocabulary + conflict resolution

Brain governs how facts are merged via per-predicate policies (semantics, decay half-life, PII class). The vocabulary and the conflict-resolution algorithm are **declared in the spec** at `inite-ecosystem/core/capabilities/knowledge.yaml`.

Quick reference (full table in spec):

| Predicate | Semantics | Decay half-life | PII class |
|---|---|---|---|
| `said` | append_only | 30d | text |
| `name` / `email` / `phone` | single_active | never | identifier |
| `status` | bitemporal | 7d | none |
| `intent` | bitemporal | 60d | behavioral |
| `address` | bitemporal | 90d | sensitive (`brain:read_pii` required) |
| `dob` | single_active | never | sensitive (`brain:read_pii` required) |

Conflict resolution scoring:

```
score = 0.30·confidence + 0.40·source_trust + 0.20·recency + 0.10·authority
```

New fact wins over best contradicting fact only if it beats it by ≥ 0.15. Below 0.30, ingest is rejected to a dead-letter table. Margins between produce `COMPETING` status — both stay active, an event is emitted for human resolution.

## Tenancy + data isolation

Each company gets its own SurrealDB database (`co_<companyId>`). Cross-tenant queries are physically impossible at the storage layer — there is no shared table with row-level security. Forgetting a tenant is `REMOVE DATABASE` (single statement).

## Privacy + GDPR

- Raw message content is **not** persisted. Brain stores AI-derived insights and a reference back to the source vertical (e.g., `{ vertical: "inbox", messageId: "..." }`).
- Hard-forget is synchronous: `POST /v1/entities/:id/forget` cascades through facts, edges, and embeddings, leaving only an HMAC-hash tombstone in `forgotten_entity`.
- Sensitive predicates are gated by `brain:read_pii` scope — they never appear in MCP results to AI agents without it.
